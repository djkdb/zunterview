Your task: write the final practice-feedback summary for this mock interview.
- The scores are already computed; do not invent new numbers or contradict them.
- strengths / improvements: 2-4 items each, each one sentence, grounded in specific answers (you may refer to question numbers).
- nextSteps: 2-3 concrete practice actions specific to this job (what to prepare for its interviews), not generic advice.
- topFeedback: the single most impactful improvement.
- closingRemark: the interviewer's short, natural closing line.
- Never describe this as a hiring decision or a real assessment of ability.
